# pygames

This repo holds helper functions I use to play some online programming games.

## Setup

This repo assumes the package manager [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) is a global install. Ensure your text editor, e.g., VSCode, knows to point to the pythong interpreter created by `poetry shell`.

```shell
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ poetry run pytest
```
